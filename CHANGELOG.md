## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-24

### 🚀 Major Update: Tauri 2.0 Migration

This release represents a significant architectural upgrade with the migration from Tauri 1.x to Tauri 2.0, introducing breaking changes in the permission system and window management.

### Added
- **Real-time Token Estimation**: Added live token counting in the editor header using `js-tiktoken`
  - Displays estimated token count for current Markdown file (gpt-4/cl100k_base encoding)
  - Shows "..." loading state when switching files or during calculation
  - 800ms debounce to prevent UI freezing during typing
  - Token count displayed in right side of editor header with "Tokens: XXX" format
  - Automatically hidden when viewing history versions
  - Uses thousand separators for better readability (e.g., "1,234")
- **Tauri 2.0 Permission System (ACL)**: Implemented comprehensive capability-based permission system
  - Created `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` with all necessary window management permissions
  - Added explicit permissions for window close, minimize, maximize, dragging, and focus operations
  - Resolved all window operation failures caused by missing permissions in Tauri 2.0

### Changed
- **Multi-Platform Window Styling**: Optimized independent window appearance for different operating systems
  - **macOS**: Large rounded corners (`rounded-xl` - 12px) with transparent background
  - **Linux**: Medium rounded corners (`rounded-lg` - 8px)
  - **Windows**: No rounded corners (sharp edges, native Windows style)
  - Window control buttons now match platform conventions (macOS left-side traffic lights, Windows/Linux right-side icons)
- **Window Controls Initialization**: Fixed platform detection to prevent style flashing
  - Changed initial platform state from "macos" to empty string
  - Added UserAgent fallback for platform detection
  - Prevents Windows/Linux users from seeing macOS-style buttons during startup
- **Transparent Window Implementation**: Improved window transparency and rounded corner rendering
  - Modified global CSS to use transparent body background
  - Moved background color to `#root` container for proper layering
  - macOS-only transparent window configuration using conditional compilation

### Fixed
- **Tauri 2.0 Window Operations**: Fixed all window management issues after Tauri 2.0 upgrade
  - Window close, minimize, maximize now work correctly with proper async/await handling
  - Window dragging via `data-tauri-drag-region` now functional with ACL permissions
  - All window API calls properly await Promise resolution
- **Window Styling Consistency**: Resolved window appearance issues across platforms
  - Fixed rounded corners not displaying on macOS due to opaque body background
  - Corrected platform-specific styling to match OS conventions
  - Eliminated style flashing when opening new windows
- **Permission Configuration**: Removed invalid `core:window:allow-set-zoom` permission that caused build errors

### Technical Details
- Added `js-tiktoken` dependency (v1.0.21) for client-side token calculation
- Implemented debounced token counting with React hooks and refs
- Created Tauri 2.0 capabilities configuration following new security model
- Updated Rust window creation code with platform-specific conditional compilation
- Enhanced CSS architecture for transparent window support

## [0.1.11] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Custom Provider Type**: Added dedicated "custom" provider type to properly distinguish custom providers from built-in OpenAI provider, eliminating configuration conflicts
- **Custom Provider Editing**: Added ability to edit custom provider configurations after creation, including name, base URL, and description. Name changes are handled by deleting the old configuration and creating a new one.
- **Custom Provider Validation**: Added validation to prevent custom provider names from conflicting with built-in provider IDs and names (case-insensitive)
- **Ollama Provider**: Added Ollama to built-in provider list with special handling:
  - No API Key required (hidden in UI)
  - Configurable Base URL for local or LAN access (default: http://localhost:11434)
  - Supports remote Ollama instances on local network
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for custom provider operations (add, update, fetch models, test connection) to help diagnose configuration issues
- **Database Migration System**: Added automatic migration for v0.1.11 to:
  - Simplify built-in provider names by removing `_default` suffix (e.g., `openai_default` → `openai`)
  - Migrate existing custom providers from 'openai' type to 'custom' type and clear their model lists

### Changed
- **Model Display Consistency**: Unified model list display across Arena and Execution panels to show provider name instead of provider type for better clarity (e.g., "Deepseek2" instead of "custom", "deepseek" instead of "deepseek")
- **Provider Naming Convention**: Simplified built-in provider names to use clean IDs (e.g., "openai", "deepseek") instead of "{id}_default" format, with validation preventing custom providers from using these reserved names

### Fixed
- **DeepSeek API Base URL**: Corrected DeepSeek base URL from `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` to `https://api.deepseek.com` according to official documentation
- **Provider Log Labels**: Fixed log messages to correctly display provider names (DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, AiHubMix) instead of always showing "OpenAI Provider" for OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Arena Mode Provider Configuration**: Fixed critical bug where Arena mode only set provider correctly for OpenRouter, causing DeepSeek and other providers to use wrong API endpoints and keys. Now all providers are correctly configured in Arena mode.
- **Custom Provider Display and Management**: Fixed custom providers not appearing in the provider list. Custom providers are now correctly identified by their unique name and custom base URL, and can be properly configured, saved, and used for execution.
- **Provider Configuration Isolation**: Fixed critical bug where built-in and custom providers with the same provider type (e.g., OpenAI) would share configurations and models. Now each provider configuration is properly isolated by unique name (built-in use `{id}_default` pattern, custom use user-defined names).
- **Custom Provider Model Fetching**: Fixed model fetching for custom providers with OpenAI-compatible APIs. The GPT model filter is now only applied to official OpenAI API, allowing custom providers to return all their models (e.g., deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner).
